# nougat

A simple WIP Navidrome UI (packaged with Electron), built in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS.  

I made this to learn/understand more about the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API).  
It is however, pretty stable and should work for 99% of use-cases.  

**This app is however, built around the Subsonic API with the Navidrome changes.**

## Notice

I haven't implemented playlists yet, but it's in the works.  
When you start Nougat, you'll see only your albums, and only the first 36 of them. This is also planned to change in the future with pagination.

## Libraries/projects used

- [js-md5](https://github.com/emn178/js-md5)
  - Used for authentication

- [contextual](https://github.com/ia74/contextual)
  - View engine for vanilla JS

## Usage

- Run `npm i`
- Run `npm start`
- and Nougat will start up!
